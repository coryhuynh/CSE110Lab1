## Who am I?
My name is Cory Huynh and I am a second year student at **UCSD**. I am taking this class to learn about the process of Software Engineering and hopefully inspire the process of becoming one myself. 
## What do I like
Some of my hobbies include gaming, playing basketball, and listening to music. I am a big Lakers fan and some of my favorite games are Skyrim, the Mass effect trilogy, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
