## Who am I?
My name is **Cory Huynh** and I am a second year Computer Engineering major at **UCSD**. I am taking this class to learn about the process of Software Engineering and hopefully inspire the journey of becoming one myself. [To my end goals](#conclusion)
## What is this?
This is the first Lab assignment of ***CSE 110: Software Engineering***. So far I have completed 2 out of the 3 tasks and am working on the third task:
- [x] Installing VSCode and extensions
- [x] Refamiliarizing myself with Git
- [ ] Using Markdown
  
The review of Git was really useful, I learned how a .gitignore file works and reviewed some basic git commands like: 
```
git checkout -b "new-branch"
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
```

## What do I like?
Some of my hobbies include gaming, playing basketball, and listening to music. I am a big Lakers fan and some of my favorite games are: 
- Skyrim
- The Mass Effect trilogy
- Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
  
I think the artists I listen to the most are:
1. Kanye West
2. Tyler the Creator
3. Frederic Chopin
4. Anderson .Paak
   
Being a UCSD student, I have grown to like racoons. Here is a good depiction of a trash panda:

## Conclusion
I hope to become a software engineer who can proudly and correctly say, as video game designer [Todd Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Howard) once said:
